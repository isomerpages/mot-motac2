### NEED FOR PROJECT
	
</center>	

* Runway excursions (veer off or overrun from the runway surface) have always been a top safety risk, with poor braking action as a key contributing factor.

![need for project 1](/images/VFM/VD1/VD1_NeedforProject1.jpg)

* IATA analysis shows that:
	* There was 1 runway excursion reported for every 1.3 million flights.
	* From 2005 to 1H 2019, approximately 23% of the accidents in IATA’s global accident database involved runway excursion.

![need for project 2](/images/VFM/VD1/VD1_NeedforProject2.jpg)

*  ICAO Friction Task Force was tasked to address the problem and developed the Global Reporting Format (GRF) for runway surface conditions.
*  GRF to be implemented by 4 Nov 2021.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

</center>

**Need to address the problem on the lack of accuracy and timeliness of assessment and reporting methods on the runway surface conditions that had contributed to many operational safety events.**

<center>

### SOLUTION

</center>

* Optimised use of existing resources and synergised the capabilities of the suite of systems:

	* Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) measures the water level along the runways automatically. This data is sent to Automatic Runway Condition Reporting (A-RCR) System for data analytics and processing.
	* A-RCR System processes the data received from AWOS and generates the corresponding Runway Condition Report (RCR). This report is sent to Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) System for processing and broadcast.
	* ATIS System receives the RCR data from A-RCR system and integrates it into the ATIS report for broadcast to aircraft (via VHF broadcast and datalink).

### SOLUTION STATEMENT

</center>
	
**Synergised the capabilities of the suite of systems, namely, AWOS, A-RCR, AIMS and ATIS systems, to collaborate on the reporting of runway surface condition in a timely, efficient and effective manner for operational safety.**

### IMPACT

</center>	
	
![](/images/VFM/VD1/VD1%20Impact%201A.png)

* Being one of the first few airports in the world to innovatively determine the real-time runway surface conditions automatically through the use of data analytics, and end-to-end integration of existing systems’ functionalities.
* Achieved higher operational efficiency, and avoidance of more than 1,000 manual measurements instances per year per runway which equates to at least 250 hours of downtime per year for each runway.
* Achieved timely reporting of updated RCR automatically when there was a change in runway surface condition.
* **Total Cost Savings: ≥ $4.80mil.**
	* **Annual Cost Savings: $1.35mil for 2 runways.**
	* **Project Cost Savings: $3.44mil through integration with existing systems.**

### OUTCOME STATEMENT

**The implemented solution had achieved an efficient way to automatically report RCR in a timely manner that led to operational efficiency, improved safety outcome and cost savings.**
