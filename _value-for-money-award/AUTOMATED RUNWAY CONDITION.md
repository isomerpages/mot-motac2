### NEED FOR PROJECT

* Runway excursions (veer off or overrun from the runway surface) have always been a top safety risk, with poor braking action as a key contributing factor.

![need for project 1](/images/VFM/VD1/VD1_NeedforProject1.jpg)

* IATA analysis shows that:
	* There was 1 runway excursion reported for every 1.3 million flights.
	* From 2005 to 1H 2019, approximately 23% of the accidents in IATA’s global accident database involved runway excursion.

*  ICAO Friction Task Force was tasked to address the problem and developed the Global Reporting Format (GRF) for runway surface conditions.
*  GRF to be implemented by 4 Nov 2021.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Need to address the problem on the lack of accuracy and timeliness of assessment and reporting methods on the runway surface conditions that had contributed to many operational safety events.**
